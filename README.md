About This Project
==================

Hi! 

I've been in IT for half a decade thus far, and never really delved into programming much apart from the various scripting
languages you come across as a system admin. After deciding to learn a language and soaking up a thick book full of 
C# knowledge, out comes my first project as a result. I decided to write an automated installer since this is something
I deal with at work and would find useful.

I know it may be overkill for the job, but hey! I learned a whole bunch of stuff and hopefully you will find 
some good use for it too!

Anyway thats enough of a rant from me - go and deploy some Zabbix agents!
